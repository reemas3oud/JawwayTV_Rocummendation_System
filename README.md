# 1. The Dataset
The first thing we need is of course the dataset. I found the dataset here and it is basically a collection extracted from  JawwyTV content puplished by STC. The IPTV dataset contains the following features and it has more than 70 million rows and the size of data is more than 1 terabyte (TB), the data are:
*  User ID
* SESSION START (DATE/TIME)
* SESSION DURATION
* PROGRAM NAME
* PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
* PREOGRAM GENRE
* PROGRAM CLASS
* SERIES TITLE
* SERIES NAME
